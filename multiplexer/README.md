In this example, we are hashing many random values (using SHA256) in parallel and printing them to stdout. We are spreading the load using a multiplexer: one input is handled in several goroutines. Multiplexers are often used in network-related applications, such as HTTP servers: one goroutine accepts the incoming connections and immediately give it to another goroutine for it to handle.
